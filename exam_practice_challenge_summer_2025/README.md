### 🔍 What You’ll Practice

This exercise is designed to assess your skills in:

* **Color selection and application**
* **Font styling** (font families, sizes, weights)
* **CSS selectors** (class, element, descendant, etc.)
* **Text alignment, spacing, and decoration**
* **Background images and gradients**
* **Box shadows, borders, and border-radius**
* **Positioning** (relative, absolute if needed)

⚠️ **You are not required to build or modify layout structure or make it responsive.**

### 🛠️ Instructions

   * Background images
   * Headings and paragraphs
   * Links and buttons
